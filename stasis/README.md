Both lockfiles and bundles only include what is actually _used_.\
Generally about 10x smaller than production-focused `node_modules` install.

Enforcing these lets you focus automated code scanning and alerts only on code that matters,
and makes the analysis import graph aware.

Ideal workflow: create bundle -> analyze -> ship _that exact bundle_ to production.

Lockfile can attest the bundle in a readable form, but that's not required - bundle itself can be an attestation.

| Lockfile | Bundle |
| -------- | ------ |
| `stasis.lock.json` | `stasis.code.br` |
| Asserts per-file content integrity and the import graph | Contains per-file content (source) and the import graph |
| Human-readable | Compressed |
| Asserts only, files are read from disk | Loads or asserts (can be used as a lockfile)|
| Modes: `add`, `replace`, `frozen`, `ignore` | Modes: `load`, `add`, `replace`, `frozen`, `ignore` |

The main difference between lockfiles and bundles is that lockfiles contain integrities, and bundles contain full content.\
See [file formats](https://github.com/ExodusOSS/stasis/blob/main/doc/file-formats.md).

Both can be run in full scope (default) or just in `node_modules` scope.

## Why a separate bundle format?

| | Stasis | JS bundlers | Sourcemaps | SEA | source + deps tarball | Containers |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Runnable | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Contains original sources | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sources match runtime | ✅ | ➖ | ❌ Deps can misreport | ➖ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dependency versions | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Import edges | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | 🔍 Implicit | 🔍 Implicit |
| Constrained to related code | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

_Lockfiles (npm/pnpm/etc) not mentioned: they are like the "tarball" column, but also require network, install step and are not self-contained._

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| - | - |
| `stasis run --lock=add app.js` | build just a lockfile |
| `stasis run --lock=frozen app.js` | verify disk against the lockfile |
| `stasis run --bundle=add app.js` | build just a bundle |
| `stasis run --bundle=frozen app.js` | verify disk against the bundle alone (self-attesting) |
| `stasis run --bundle=load app.js` | run from the bundle alone |
| `stasis run --lock=add --bundle=add app.js` | build a lockfile and bundle together |
| `stasis run --lock=frozen --bundle=load app.js` | run from the bundle, verified against the lockfile |
| `stasis run --lock=add --bundle=add --mock app.js` | build without the app's side effects (network, fs writes) |
| `stasis run --lock=add --child-process app.js` | also attest modules loaded in forked child processes (e.g. Metro transform workers) |
| `stasis run --bundle=add --fs=sync app.js` | build a bundle that also captures sync `fs.readFileSync`/`readdirSync` reads |
| `stasis run --lock=add --import=./instrument.mjs app.js` | forward extra preload modules (repeatable) to the node process running the entry: a preload's own module graph is runner infrastructure like stasis's loader itself — evaluated, but not captured. Modules the app graph *also* reaches (or that execute through a preload-transplanted `require()` pipeline) are still attested like any other app code, so frozen replays and `--bundle=load` stay fail-closed |
| `stasis bundle src/index.js` | build a bundle statically, without executing it |
| `stasis bundle --add src/worker.js` | merge more entries (and their import graph) into an existing `stasis.code.br` instead of replacing it |
| `stasis add a.js icon.svg` | add the listed files to the project's bundles (config-driven), with no dependency resolution |
| `stasis add src assets` | same, expanding each directory to every file under it, minus an auto-excluded set unless explicitly named |
| `stasis bundle --conditions=react-native,browser app.js` | statically bundle, asserting extra `exports`/`imports` resolution conditions |
| `stasis bundle --mainFields=react-native,browser,main app.js` | statically bundle, honoring legacy package `mainFields` (incl. browser-field object redirection) |
| `stasis bundle --metro --platforms=ios,android app.js` | statically bundle the way Metro resolves: RN conditions + mainFields + `.ios`/`.android`/`.native` suffixes, all platforms at once, plus each bundled native dependency's `ios/`/`android/` sources + podspec |
| `stasis bundle --metro --metro-resolver --platforms=ios,android app.js` | same, but resolve through the project's own `metro-resolver` (byte-for-byte Metro fidelity) instead of the built-in approximation; requires `metro-resolver` installed (it ships with `react-native`/`metro`) |
| `stasis bundle --flow app.js` | statically bundle Flow-typed sources: when oxc can't parse a `.js`/`.cjs`/`.mjs` file, strip its Flow syntax and retry so the import graph resolves (needs the optional `flow-remove-types` dependency; the stored source stays the original bytes). Combines with `--jsx`/`--conditions`/`--mainFields`/`--metro` |
| `stasis bundle --typescript src/index.ts` | statically bundle TS sources that import by output name, the way tsc resolves: a `./x.js` (or `.mjs`/`.cjs`) specifier with no such file on disk lands on its on-disk `./x.ts` (`.mts`/`.cts`) source, and an extensionless `./x` probes `./x.ts` and `./x/index.ts`; the same substitution applies to package `main`/`exports`/`imports` targets and bare subpaths, and an existing `.js` always wins over its `.ts` twin. Combines with `--jsx` (also maps to `.tsx`)/`--conditions`/`--mainFields`/`--metro` (not `--metro-resolver`, which can't substitute) |
| `stasis bundle --typescript --tsconfig=tsconfig.build.json src/index.ts` | same, honoring tsconfig `compilerOptions.paths` aliases (e.g. `"@/*": ["./src/*"]`, resolved against `baseUrl`, `extends` followed) for bare specifiers nothing else resolves; without `--tsconfig`, the project root's tsconfig.json applies when present |
| `stasis github-bundle --github=owner/name [--sha=<commit>] [--tag=<name>] [--directory=path] [--package-manager=pnpm] [src/index.js]` | statically bundle a GitHub repo at a commit, or the one `--tag` names (the default branch's head without either), as `stasis bundle` bundles a clone of it once installed: the tree is fetched (with `GITHUB_TOKEN` where set) and held to its git tree id, and the dependencies are laid out in memory from the lockfile alone (`pnpm`, `yarn1`, or `soldeer` for `.sol` entries; without `--package-manager`, the one whose lockfile installs the directory, where only one's does), with nothing installed and no package script run; where no entries are given, they are the JS files the directory's `package.json` names (`main`, `exports`, `bin`), resolved as the build resolves (`--conditions`, `--mainFields`, `--metro --platforms`, `--typescript`), or for Soldeer its `.sol` files directly in it, under `contracts/`, and under its source directory (`foundry.toml`'s `src`, else `src/`), but tests, scripts, mocks and dependency or build directories; takes `stasis bundle`'s options for the entries and `--lockfile` (as a library: `buildGitHubBundle` in `@exodus/stasis/vfs-bundle`, and `suggestedEntries` for the entries it would take, of a GitHub repo or a Vfs) |
| `stasis build --output=out.js app.stasis.code.br [entry]` | rebuild a runnable JS bundle with esbuild, following the bundle's recorded import graph exactly (entry optional when the bundle has one) |
| `stasis build --output=out.js stasis.lock.json [entry]` | same, reading + verifying sources from disk against the lockfile |
| `stasis extract app.stasis.code.br` | unpack a bundle back to sources + a `stasis.lock.json` |
| `stasis diff --stat a.lock.json b.stasis.code.br` | summarize module/file differences between two lockfiles/bundles |
| `stasis prune` | trim `node_modules` to the lockfile, verifying the rest |
| `stasis audit stasis.lock.json` | report npm advisories for a lockfile's dependencies |
| `stasis audit app.stasis.code.br` | report advisories for a bundle's dependencies: npm packages by npm's advisories, vendored crates and Composer packages by OSV's, and Soldeer packages and GitHub repos (Foundry's `lib/`) by those their GitHub repository publishes, asked with `GITHUB_TOKEN` where it is set; a Composer dev version is listed as not audited |
| `stasis audit --why app.stasis.code.br` | same, with the cross-module import paths that pull each flagged package in (`run: a -> b -> c`), prefixed by the consumer that imports each chain at the top level; a chain is skipped when its full tail is already listed as its own chain |
| `stasis audit --why-deep app.stasis.code.br` | like `--why`, but keep those longer chains too (every path, shared tails collapsed to `a -> b -> ... -> d`) |
| `stasis audit --why-full app.stasis.code.br` | like `--why`, but spell every chain out with no `...` collapse (combine with `--why-deep` for the complete raw listing) |
| `stasis audit --reason=run app.stasis.code.br` | show only advisories related to one consumer (`run`); with `--why`, keep only that consumer's chains |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN=... stasis audit --repo-advisories stasis.lock.json` | also ask each dependency's GitHub repository for the advisories its maintainers published there, which npm's database has only once GitHub reviews them; needs a GitHub token in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Each package's repository is cached for a month in the user cache directory (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/stasis`, `~/.cache/stasis`, `~/Library/Caches/stasis` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\stasis\Cache` on Windows) |
| `stasis sbom --format=spdx stasis.lock.json` | export an SPDX SBOM for a lockfile or bundle |
| `stasis sbom --format=cyclonedx app.stasis.code.br` | export a CycloneDX SBOM for a lockfile or bundle |

## Runtime
