// `stasis audit --why` support: from an artifact's resolution graph (`imports`)
// and its per-consumer provenance (`reason`), explain WHY a vulnerable module is
// present by listing the cross-module import chains that reach it.
//
// Corrections apply at the EDGE level (see audit-corrections.js): an edge whose
// target file is not evidence of the module's real code -- a package.json
// manifest read, or a corrected file like ws's noop browser.js stub -- never
// enters the graph, so no displayed chain ends with (or passes through) one, and
// a consumer that recorded only such files of a package is not one of its reasons.
//
// A "path" is a chain of node_modules packages ending at the target module, e.g.
// `a -> b -> c`. The first-party (`src`) node is never shown: a chain is walked
// back through cross-module edges and stops at a HEAD -- a module that a src file
// imports directly, OR one nothing else in node_modules imports (the top of its
// dependency subtree). So `a -> b -> c` surfaces even when no src file imports
// `a` directly (a is the top of the chain), and `b -> c` surfaces additionally
// when `b` is itself imported by src.
//
// The reasons shown for a flagged package are EXACTLY the ones that recorded the
// package itself -- the same set the non-`--why` column reports (see collectReasons).
// `--why` only adds, per reason, HOW that reason reaches it. So a consumer that
// imports a package but never recorded it (externalized it) is not one of its
// reasons and is never shown; and every reason that did record it appears, at least
// as a bare line.
//
// The per-reason PATH is file-level. A consumer "has" the edge `b -> c` only if it
// recorded the specific file in `b` that imports `c`, so a chain belongs to a
// consumer only when it recorded the file forming EVERY edge -- `metro: a -> b -> c`
// can't appear if the file importing `c` from `b` isn't metro's. Each reason's
// chains are enumerated on its own subgraph (only its edges), so it shows its
// MAXIMAL file-level path: if metro's edges only reach up to `b`, its line is the
// shorter `metro: b -> c`; a reason that recorded the package but never imports it
// through the graph shows a bare `metro: c`. A bundle with a single consumer omits
// the `reason` map entirely; there every chain renders bare, with no prefix.

// Cap on paths enumerated per target to bound pathological graphs (many diamond
// dependencies compound into a combinatorial number of simple paths). Hitting it
// is surfaced as a marker line rather than silently dropped.

// Packages a chain never walks PAST: everything imports these build/runtime hubs,
