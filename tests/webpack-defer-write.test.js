// StasisWebpack writes a sidecar/standalone bundle on compiler.hooks.done. webpack fires that
// hook once PER CHILD COMPILER, so a MultiCompiler with N targets sharing one plugin instance
// would re-serialize + brotli-compress (quality 11, super-linear in size) the whole, ever-growing
// bundle N times. The fix defers ONLY that multi-compiler one-shot case to a single
// beforeExit/exit flush (one write of the final bundle); a single compiler keeps the immediate
// write-on-`done`, and watch mode is refused outright at watchRun (capture's path-keyed dedupe
// would silently attest stale content on a rebuild). No real webpack here -- a fake compiler
// exposing the hooks the plugin taps (normalModuleFactory, watchRun, done) drives the completion
// logic; afterResolve lets a test feed the plugin a real source file so the deferred write's
// CONTENT can be checked.
//
// Test 1 (single) and Test 2 (multi) are the regression guards: revert the fix to a direct
// write()-in-`done` and Test 2's "deferred until flush" assertions fail. The remaining cases pin
// the fix's other properties (exit-path durability, retry-after-throw, watch refusal, failed
// builds, byte content).
